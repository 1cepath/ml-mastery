# Python Machine Learning Mini Course

## Provided by Jason @ ML Mastery

### Introduction

My name is Nathan Fritter and I am a data geek. I have a B.S. in Applied Statistics from UCSB
and was an active member of the Data Science club at UCSB. I made numerous projects, presented
my findings and also was a member on the executive board. Feel free to view other projects
from the club as well as ones that I have completed for classes.

### The Course
This project is inspired by the content [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/MLMastery/machine_learning_mastery_with_python_mini_course.pdf?__s=mxhvphowryg2sfmzus2q).

I have also added in my own comments, methods, and explanations of my thought process. 
Feel free to clone the repo, make a branch, leave comments or contribute in any way you'd like.

### Steps to Reproduction

+ Clone the repo onto your machine (instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) if you are not familiar)
+ Download the package `virtualenv`
	+ Assuming you have made it this far you should have experience with one of `pip/pip3`, `brew` or another package manager
	+ Here we will use `pip3` (python3 compatible)
+ Run the following commands:
	+ `virtualenv venv` 
		+ This creates a virtual environment called "venv"
		+ Feel free to change the second word to whatever you'd like to call it
	+ `source venv/bin/activate` 
		+ This turns on the virtual environment and puts you in it
	+ `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
		+ Installs every python package listed in the requirements.txt file
	+ `python3 miniCourse.py *number*
		+ Examine the code and replace *number* with whichever part you'd like to run

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute:
+ Create a new branch to work on (instructions [here](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches))
	+ By default the branch you will receive after cloning is the "master" branch
	+ This is where the main changes are deployed, so it should not contain any of your code unless the changes have been agreed upon by all parties (which is the purpose of creating the new branch
	+ This way you must submit a request to push changes to the main branch)
+ Submit changes as a pull request with any relevant information commented
	+ Reaching out in some way would also be great to help speed up the process

If you do contribute, I will add your name as a contributor!

### Iterations

This is a work in progress; I initally split up everything into parts depending on the minicourse.

However I will be splitting up by the different applications used, as this is better python practice.
